# SSRS

This exercise is to practice how to create a basic customer list table report in SSRS, as well as an interactive table and matrix table report.

Before navigate the project, you need to restore "Galactic.bak" file into your SQL Server database, since this is the source data we need to use for practice.

The operation platform: Windows 10 + SQL Server 2016 + Visual Studio 2015(SSDT).

The project includes 3 reports:

## Customer List.rdl
This is the basic report to show the customer list.

## Customer-Invoice Report.rdl
This is the interactive report which the user can drill up/down the table to navigate the data.

## Invoice-Batch Number Report.rdl
This is the matrix report to play with report parameters.
